# Retrospective
 
What went well:
Our team worked very well together. We collaborated and agreed upon a Kaggle dataset immediately, which helped us get ahead of schedule. In our first meeting, we were able to make plans for our project deliverables and delegate the appropriate tasks to each team member. We established a great understanding of the dataset, which helped us come up with some ideas on how to start cleaning and analyzing the data. When there was a team member that struggled with a particular task, we all brainstormed ideas on how to overcome that task.
What went poorly:
Our data contained a lot of categorical data rather than numerical. We had a difficult time finding out which type of visualizations worked best with the data. Sometimes we overthought problems that would typically have been a simple fix. These issues caused us to finish the project later than expected.
What we can Improve:
Now that we have a better understanding of which types of charts and graphs to use for which types of data, we can manipulate the data and get even more insights in the future. We also learned that it’s best to begin setting up a GitHub and adding all teammates to the repository before the start of the project. This really helps with organization and ensures that all team members are on the same page at all times.
